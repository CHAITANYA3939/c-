Write a c++ program to find a farmer is asking you to tell him how many legs can be counted among all his animals. The farmer breeds three species: chickens = 2 legs cows = 4 legs pigs = 4 legs The farmer has counted his animals and he gives you a subtotal for each species. You have to implement a function that returns the total number offlegs of all the animals.

#include <iostream>
int countLegs(int chickens, int cows, int pigs) {
    return chickens * 2 + cows * 4 + pigs * 4;
}

int main() {
    int chickens, cows, pigs;
    std::cout << "Enter number of chickens: ";
    std::cin >> chickens;
    std::cout << "Enter number of cows: ";
    std::cin >> cows;
    std::cout << "Enter number of pigs: ";
    std::cin >> pigs;

    int totalLegs = countLegs(chickens, cows, pigs);
    std::cout << "Total legs: " << totalLegs << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

Write a c++ program to Declare a class box, with length(Public variable) and width(Private variable) use setwidth ()and getwidth() function to set and display width and length.

#include <iostream>

class Box {
public:
    int length;
private:
    int width;

public:
    void setWidth(int w) {
        width = w;
    }

    int getWidth() {
        return width;
    }
};

int main() {
    Box box;
    box.length = 10;
    box.setWidth(5);

    std::cout << "Length: " << box.length << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Width: " << box.getWidth() << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
write a c++Given N and an array(say coins[]) that contains some numbers (coins in rupees) .
N is a coin, and the array contains various coins. The task is to make the change of N using the coins of the array. Make a change in such a way that a minimum number of coins are used.
Let us take a input array coins[] = {10, 25, 5}, total coins = 3
We have N = 30.
The output is two as we can use one 25 rupee coin and a 5 rupee coin to make 30. (25 + 5 = 30)
Similarly, coins [] = {1, 9, 6, 5}, total coins = 4
N = 13
The output is three as we need two 6 rupees coins and one 1 rupee coin. (6 + 6 + 1 = 13)

#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>

int minCoins(int N, std::vector<int> coins) {
    std::sort(coins.begin(), coins.end());
    int numCoins = 0;
    for (int i = coins.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (N == 0) {
            break;
        }
        if (N >= coins[i]) {
            int count = N / coins[i];
            N = N % coins[i];
            numCoins += count;
        }
    }
    return numCoins;
}

int main() {
    std::vector<int> coins1 = {10, 25, 5};
    std::vector<int> coins2 = {1, 9, 6, 5};

    std::cout << "Minimum coins required for 30: " << minCoins(30, coins1) << std::endl;
    std::cout << "Minimum coins required for 13: " << minCoins(13, coins2) << std::endl;

    return 0;
}

Declare a class box, with length(Public variable) and width(Private variable) use setwidth ()and getwidth() function to set and display width and length.
Input:
Enter the Length of box :6
Enter the width of box :9
Output :
Length of box :6
Width of box :9


#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

class Box {
public:
    int length;
private:
    int width;

public:
    void setWidth(int w) {
        width = w;
    }

    int getWidth() {
        return width;
    }

    void display() {
        cout << "Length of box :" << length << endl;
        cout << "Width of box :" << width << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Box box;
    cout << "Enter the Length of box :";
    cin >> box.length;
    cout << "Enter the width of box :";
    int w;
    cin >> w;
    box.setWidth(w);
    box.display();
    return 0;
}
